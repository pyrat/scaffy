h2. Scaffy Generator

An opinionated cut down scaffold generator. This uses haml for templates and includes tests in vanilla test/unit. Nothing fancy, nothing special. Just a really fast way to use scaffolding without it being rubbish.

h2. Install

<pre lang="bash">script/plugin install [insert scaffold link]</pre>

h3. Usage

Once you install the gem, the generators will be available to all Rails
applications on your system. If you run script/generate without any
additional arguments you should see the available generators listed.

To run the generator, go to your rails project directory and call it
using the script/generate or script/destroy command.

<pre lang="bash">script/generate scaffy Comment email:string content:text index new</pre>

Run the command with the <tt>--help</tt> option to learn more.

<pre lang="bash">
script/generate scaffy --help
</pre>

h3. Troubleshooting

<b>I get a missing database error.</b>

Run <tt>rake db:migrate</tt>.

<b>Forms don't work.</b>

Try restarting your development server. Sometimes it doesn't detect the
change in the routing.
